#CFShareCircle

CFShareCircle is a better way for app developers to let users share the content to many different services. It is a simple UIView that adds drag and share capabilities to a developers application. View was only tested on iOS 6.0, but should be 5.1+ capable.

##How To Use

Follow the instructions to add CFShareCircle to your project.

###Basic Setup

1. Add the following frameworks to your project under "Link Binary With Libraries" in "Build Phases".

        - UIKit
        - QuartzCore
        - Foundation
        - CoreGraphics

2. Under the "CFShareCircle" directory copy the "Images" directory under "Resources" to your project. Then also copy over the CFShareCirleView and CFSharer files located under "Classes". Make sure that the CFShareCircle.m, CFShareCircle.h, CHSharer.m, and CFSharer.h are listed under "Copy Bundle Resources" under "Build Phases".

3. Edit your view controller header file to import the CFShareCircle header file, add the delegate, and create an object.

    ```
    #import "CFShareCircleView.h"
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController <CFShareCircleViewDelegate>{    
        CFShareCircleView *shareCircleView;        
    }
      ```
      
4. In your viewDidLoad method instantiate the CFShareCircle, set up the delegate, and add it to your navigation controller.
```
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        shareCircleView = [[CFShareCircleView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame];
        shareCircleView.delegate = self;
        [self.navigationController.view addSubview:shareCircleView];
        [super viewDidLoad];
}
```

5. Implement the delegate method for the view. Note: Index returned from the view is in order of the array (i.e. Starts from pi = 0 on the unit circle).
``` 
    - (void)shareCircleView:(CFShareCircleView *)shareCircleView didSelectIndex:(int)index{
        NSLog(@"Selected index: %d", index);
    }
```

6. Finally just animate in the view whenever you want it pop up for the user.
```
    [shareCircleView animateIn];
```

###Customize CFShareCirlce

If you would like to determine what the CFShareCircle view shows, all you have to do is intialize your own array of sharers.

```
shareCircleView = [[CFShareCircleView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame sharers:[[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects: [[CFSharer alloc] initWithType:CFSharerTypeTwitter ], [[CFSharer alloc] initWithType:CFSharerTypeFacebook], nil]];
```

Then to extend this you can create your own CFSharer objects, just provide your own name for the sharer and image. Note that icons should be 100px by 100px for @2x and 50px by 50px for standard.

```
CFSharer *newSharer = [[CFSharer alloc] initWithName:@"Facebook" imageName:@"facebook.png"];
```

    - Evernote
    - Twitter
    - Google Drive

    - Pinterest
    - Dropbox
